# Web-Code-Editor
The Web-Code-Editor project aims to create a simple yet powerful code editor application using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will allow users to write, edit, and execute code of HTML, CSS and Javascript languages in real-time, with syntax highlighting and other helpful features commonly found in code editors.

# Technologies Used:

- React.js: For building the user interface and managing state.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application.
- JavaScript: For implementing functionality and interactions.
- CodeMirror: For the core code editing features.
- React Router: For managing navigation within the application (if multiple views are required).
